# unityBoids
C# and HLSL code to run the boids simulation for Unity Game Engine

How to make it work:
1. Create a new project in Unity, make sure to select 2D(you can select 3D if you want but then you will most likely have to change a few things in the code)
2. Select the Main Camera and the C# script to it
3. In the Inspector add the Compute Shader script
4. Select the amount of boids to spawn
5. Press Play and everything should be working
6. While ingame you can change the parameters through the inspector to play around with the result
